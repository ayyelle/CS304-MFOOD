Project Description
Our application, Order Up, provides both customers, restaurant employees, and restaurant owners an easy way to create and manage restaurant reservations.
The customer is able to create new reservations, as well as see future reservations and delete future reservations. To help them make good decisions
about where they want to eat, the application provides functionalities like viewing/adding reviews, seeing the ratings for restaurants and viewing 
the menus of the restaurants.

From the restaurant's perspective, they are able to keep track of what reservations they have made, and also make reservations on their side.
Owners can manage various aspect of their restaurants such as adding new menu items, changing their restaurant's name/location, and adding
more employee logins. In addition, both owners and employees are able to view their menu, view reviews about their restaurant, and view/delete reservations
that customers have made at their restaurant. They can also add reservations, in case customers call or walk into the restaurant wanting to make a reservation.

Changes to Schema:
Added new attribute, numBookings to hasTable to keep track of the total number of reservations ever requested on that table. 
Added new attribute, img, to restaurant, so an image of the restaurant can be stored along with the restaurant's general information.
Added check constraint to restaurant: the restaurant name cannot be less than 3 characters long, and the location cannot be less than 3 characters long.
This helps to ensure that incorrect/mistyped names and locations are not inserted into the database.
