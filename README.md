Note about the database connection from Lauren :) 
- I added the classes12.zip to my build path, but make sure it's on yours when you pull the edits
- I have my credentials in there, so just change that to yours :)

Also - make sure you have the DatePicker jar file in your buildpath:
https://jdatepicker.org
